Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Environmental and Resource Economics at the [University of Connecticut](https://are.uconn.edu/). 
<br/>

My research focuses on environmental and resource economics, development economics, and political economy. I use econometric and geospatial tools to study natural resource governance and the effects of resource booms and energy transitions on governments, firms, workers, and the environment.  <br/>

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/institutes/iee/) and a Fulbright Research Fellow at [Unicamp](https://www.eco.unicamp.br/nea/), in Brazil. I earned my PhD from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://aae.wisc.edu/) in 2022.
